These frequently asked questions can be used on store listings or support pages.

## General Questions

### What does LinkedIn Formatter do?

LinkedIn Formatter adds text formatting options to your LinkedIn post editor. It allows you to create posts with bold, italic, and underlined text, helping your content stand out in the LinkedIn feed.

### Is it free to use?

Yes, LinkedIn Formatter is completely free to use with no in-app purchases or premium features.

### Does it work on all browsers?

LinkedIn Formatter is available for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. It works on desktop browsers only, not on mobile apps.

### Will it work on the LinkedIn mobile app?

No, browser extensions only work on desktop browsers, not on mobile apps. This extension will not affect your LinkedIn mobile app experience.

## Features and Usage

### How do I use the formatting options?

1. Start creating a new LinkedIn post
2. Select the text you want to format
3. Click one of the formatting buttons (B for bold, I for italic, U for underline)
4. To remove formatting, select the text and click the T button

### What is the character counter for?

LinkedIn has a 3000-character limit for posts. The character counter helps you track how many characters you've used and how many you have left. It changes color (orange, then red) as you approach the limit.

### Can I use multiple formats on the same text?

Yes, you can apply multiple formats to the same text. For example, you can make text both bold and underlined.

### Does the formatting stay when others view my post?

Yes, the formatting is done using special Unicode characters that display on all devices and platforms, so your formatting will be visible to everyone who views your post.

## Technical Questions

### How does the formatting work?

Instead of using HTML tags (which LinkedIn strips out), LinkedIn Formatter uses special Unicode character variants to represent bold, italic, and underlined text. This approach ensures your formatting remains intact when posted.

### Does it modify my LinkedIn account?

No, LinkedIn Formatter only adds buttons to the post editor interface and formats text within the editor. It doesn't modify your account settings or post content after publishing.

### Does it collect my data?

No, LinkedIn Formatter does not collect, store, or transmit any of your data. It works entirely within your browser and only on LinkedIn post editor pages.

### Will it slow down my browser?

No, LinkedIn Formatter is extremely lightweight. It only activates on LinkedIn post editor pages and uses minimal resources.

## Troubleshooting

### The formatting buttons are not appearing

Make sure:

1. You're on the LinkedIn feed page (linkedin.com/feed)
2. You've clicked to create a new post
3. The extension is enabled in your browser
4. Try refreshing the page or restarting your browser

### The character counter is incorrect

The character counter counts Unicode characters, which may differ slightly from LinkedIn's internal counting in some edge cases. If you're very close to the limit, consider keeping some buffer space.

### The formatting isn't working for certain characters

The formatting works best with standard Latin alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z) and numbers (0-9). Some special characters, emojis, or non-Latin scripts may not format correctly.
